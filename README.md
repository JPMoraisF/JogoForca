# A simple Hangman game based on ReactJS

This is a simple Hangman game based on ReactJS. Any help would be greatly appreciated!  

The rules are simple: You have 5 chances to guess the name of a random country. The countries name is in portuguese, although you can change that in the <code>src/components/wordSelector.js</code> file.

  

In the project directory, you can run:

  

### `yarn start`

  

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

  

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

That's everything you need to know, there are no tests, nor anything else. Half the time i don't know what i'm doing really. THis JS thing is somwthing new for me.
